# Logbook
A logbook app design to be used by engineers to capture design decision and build with SwiftUI and firebase.

# My Figma Design file is available!
Please look [here](https://www.figma.com/file/IQjYb5gpAZ3EYKQa6fR0kW/Final-Year-Project---E-logbook?type=design&node-id=0-1).

## Why
This is my Final Year Project while studying as a mechanical engineering student.
The key of this app is to able to log different projects in a single app and manage the stage of the project by providing different log features such as using image, video, documentation and voice recording.

## Requirements 
- iOS 15.2
